# StopDecompilingMyJava

This repository, inspired by [samczun's repository (fork)](https://github.com/Janmm14/decompiler-vulnerabilities-and-bugs),
contains various edge cases known to cause Java reverse-engineering tools to be buggy. Some differences between
samczun's repository and this one for decompiler vulnerabilities are:
* No scoring system.
* The edge cases found in this repository also aim to work against RE tools in general, not just the 5 in samczsun's repository.
