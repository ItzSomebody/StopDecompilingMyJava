# Entry-003
Sets the path of a class to META-INF/\u0000/ which is a method of hiding classes against file
archivers popularized by samczsun. According to samczsun, this also causes issues with Java 7,
so you were warned.

## Non-Java Archivers
Non-Java archivers (7zip, WinRAR, Windows, etc.) are unable to display the classes.
